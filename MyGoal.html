            <p id="project-description">In Taiwan, the education system is rigorous, with a focus on exams. The GSAT exam determines college admissions, leading
            students to spend much of their childhood studying for it. This often comes at the expense of learning new skills and
            pursuing personal interests.</p>
            <p>As I observe them for the past few years, I notice a concerning trend: many lack a clear vision for the future. Their
            focus seems fixed on school selection and scores, with aspirations revolving around desired colleges rather than genuine
            interests. This realization prompts me to consider how I might assist them in reflecting on their goals and devising
            strategies to achieve them.</p>
            <p>
                The Goal app is designed to facilitate deep introspection and goal setting. It guides users to consider their life
            goals, identify necessary steps and actions, and incorporates motivational quotes. With the Goal app, students can shift
            their focus from studying for rankings to shaping their futures and striving toward personal aspirations.
