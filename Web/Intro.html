            <p>My name is HungYeh Chiang, and I hail from NeiHu Senior High School's Computer Science Special Class.
                This marks the inception of my coding journey. My fascination with coding ignited in 2022 upon delving
                into the stories of tech visionaries such as Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, who have remained my idols ever
                since.</p>

            <p>Over the past three years, my coding journey has solidified my resolve to pursue Information Science as
                my field of study. My aspirations lead me to delve deeper into Artificial Intelligence and algorithms,
                preparing myself for the future landscape of technological advancement.</p>

            <p>During my college tenure, I aim to utilize my free time to engage in internships, thereby garnering
                invaluable practical experience. Additionally, I intend to actively participate in various activities
                and competitions to further hone my development skills. Moreover, I am keen on enrolling in
                business-related courses to refine my acumen in business management.</p>

            <p>Every endeavor I undertake is geared towards realizing my dream of establishing a tech company that
                contributes positively to our planet. Post-graduation, should my startup venture flourish, I will
                dedicate myself to its continuous growth. However, if the timing isn't conducive for my entrepreneurial
                pursuits, I am inclined to seek employment as a software engineer to glean insights into corporate
                dynamics and operations.</p>
